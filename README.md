# ekf_slam_in_cxx
This is my implementation of EKF SLAM and is greatly inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/snmnmin12/ekf-slam), and will further be extended to a ROSified version.

# How do you install it?

# How do you turn this on?

Of course you may laugh at my code and fork it to make it better, that would be totally appreciated, but I challenge you to cite my work because there is no Bibtex citation to be copy-pasted either. LOL
